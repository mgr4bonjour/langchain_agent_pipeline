✅ Project: LangChain Agent Pipeline
🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates a LangChain agent pipeline that routes user queries to different tools based on their intent using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo. The agent dynamically selects whether to respond with a Wikipedia summary, evaluate a math expression, or return a weather placeholder based on the user input.


🧠 Features
🌐 Query Wikipedia for knowledge-based questions
➗ Evaluate simple math expressions
🌤 Return a mock weather response (can be extended to real API)
🔀 Uses LangChain's zero-shot-react-description agent for dynamic tool selection
🧪 Interactive command-line interface
